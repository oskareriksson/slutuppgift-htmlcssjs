### School: Lernia Stockholm, Sweden.

### Program: JavaScript developer - Front End, YHJUST16.

### Course: HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Webstandards.

#### Technologies

* HTML for structure.
* CSS for design.
* Bootstrap 3 for additional structure/styling.
* JavaScript/jQuery for functionality.
* Git for version control.

#### Properly tested resolutions

* 1920x1080px, desktop.
* 1280x800px, Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet, landscape.
* 375x559px, iPhone 6, portrait.

#### Description

A single page website made for a fictional photographer Alan Alanson. The website features his work and allows the user to get in touch with him by entering their information in a form.

#### Workflow

I made this website with Desktop-first in mind as it was the approach I felt most comfortable with at the time. However in hindsight I definitely feel that I should've gone with Mobile-first approach for easier CSS scaling, to be able to take full advantage of Bootstraps column classes and to make the website faster on mobile devices.

Other than that I am satisfied with the end result. Its looks the way I want it to on the resolutions listed above and the functions work as intended.

#### Potential future improvements

* Making some sort of image slider for each category, so you can preview the pictures in higher resolution.
* Connecting the form funcitonality to back-end so that it actually sends something and not just clear the inputs.
* Make the social media tip actually link to a persons social media(if the site is made for an actual person).
* Make some additions to the validate forms function so that it checks for a valid email adress and not just > 0 characters.
* Optimize image sizes for faster loading on all devices.
