### Description

A website made for a fictional photographer Alan Alanson. The website features his work and allows the user to get in touch with him by entering their information in a form.

### Workflow

I made this website with Desktop-first in mind as it was the approach I felt most comfortable with at the time. However in hindsight I definitely feel that I should've gone with Mobile-first approach for easier CSS scaling, be able to take full advantage of Bootstraps column classes and to make the website faster on mobile devices.

Other than that I am satisfied with the end result. Its looks the way I want it to on the resolutions listed above and the functions work as intended.

### Potential future improvements

* Making some sort of image slider for each category, so you can preview the pictures in higher resolution.
* Connecting the form funcitonality to back-end so that it actually sends something and not just clear the inputs.
* Make the social media tip actually link to a persons social media(if the site is made for an actual person).
